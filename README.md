## Overview

The Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) method can increase oil reservoir recovery by up to 60-70%. (Vesna, K.M., et.al., 2014). The DoM-EOR helps users determine the best method for enhancing oil recovery using EOR screening criteria. Enhanced oil recovery techniques are critical for maximizing oil production from reservoirs, but selecting the best technique can be challenging. EOR techniques are broken down into thermal, chemical, miscible/immiscible gas injection, etc., depending on the type of reservoir pressure, rock type, density, viscosity, oil saturation, formation type, net thickness, permeability, depth, and temperature. This app simplifies the screening process by providing a user-friendly interface to input reservoir characteristics, fluid properties, and operational constraints. The app then evaluates different EOR methods based on these criteria and recommends the most suitable technique for a given reservoir.
